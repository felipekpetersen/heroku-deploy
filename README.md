## Installation

This is a Heroku client plugin and as such requires the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) to be installed.

```shell
heroku plugins:install https://github.com/hyperoslo/heroku-deploy.git
```


## Usage

By default, the `master` branch will be deployed to your Heroku app:

```shell
heroku deploy
```

A different branch may be provided:

```shell
heroku deploy feature/plus-ux
```

If you have multiple apps, you may specify either app or remote:

```shell
heroku deploy -a hyper-rocks-staging
heroku deploy -r staging
```


## Features

* Supports multiple languages and frameworks using deploy packs (see below)
* Streams output from subcommands
* Relies on UNIX exit statuses to abort deployment early in case of failure


## Deploy Packs

A deploy pack represents a set of deployment instructions for a given language or framework. These instructions could range from turning on maintenance mode, scaling processes to scheduling backups.

At present, only Ruby on Rails and Django is supported. Deploying any other applications? Please open a pull request!
